# Analysis of Buell Monoploids

Dataset for monoploids acquired from <a href='http://www.plantcell.org/content/early/2016/01/14/tpc.15.00538.abstract'> Hardigan et al., *Plant Cell* 2016</a>.

The plan is to (1) generate bin-by-sam dosage plots (2) generate SNP plots to test robustness of our SNP-calling protocols

------

### (1) Dosage analysis can be found [here] (https://github.com/ekhtan/Buell_Monoploids/blob/master/Dosage_Analysis.md)

Summary of results: We observed some chromosomal regions that are underrepresented in some monoploid or doubled monoploid lines but did not find regions that are completely absent.

### (2) SNP analysis can be found [here] ()
